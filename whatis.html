	<h2>First of all, What is Everything.io?</h2> 
	<p>
Everything.io is a website where, well, everything is here! We have a world of knowledge and fun from books to Pusheen. There
are many different types of pages on this site. In one type, like <a href="https://ellabc23.github.io/everything.io/books.ht
ml"> Butterfly Books, </a> you read the given text and vote on the poll. In another type of page, such as <a href="https://ellabc23.
github.io/everything.io/track.html">Log Your Account,</a> you become your own character and log your self-appointed username.
		However, if you submit your ideas to <a href="https://ellabc23.github.io/everything.io
/choosenew.html">Choose New Pages,</a> your username and/or idea(s) might be featured in a new roleplay world!
	
	
<h2>What are the Rules?</h2>
	
	<p> • While on chats, please don't overdo romance or cuss. Keep it PG.</p> 
<br>
<p> • Don't bully or harm other characters or other active patrons. For example, you can't write, 'Lizzie turned around, ready to return home, when John pushed
  her into the lava.' You CAN write, 'Lizzie turned around, ready to return home, when John saved her from falling in the lava in front
  of her.' You CAN put your character in danger, if you do not make it brutal or if your character is severely harmed.

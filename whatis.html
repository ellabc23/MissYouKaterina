<h2>How to Use this Website</h2>
	<h3>
	<p> â€¢ While on chats, please don't overdo romance or cuss. Keep it PG.</p> 
<br>
<p> â€¢ Don't bully or harm other characters or other active patrons. For example, you can't write, 'Lizzie turned around, ready to return home, when John pushed
  her into the lava.' You CAN write, 'Lizzie turned around, ready to return home, when John saved her from falling in the lava in front
  of her.' You CAN put your character in danger, if you do not make it brutal or if your character is severely harmed.

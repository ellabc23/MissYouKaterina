Ella made this website for you, YES YOU, KATERINA!!! Because you are moving to Ohio, Ella put together a Kudoboard with some of your friends from Taylor! This website is
		a part of the EVIL PLOT to... well, it's not really an evil plot... but I wanted to make it dramatic ðŸ˜„
	
	
<h2>How to Use this Website</h2>
	
	<p> â€¢ While on chats, please don't overdo romance or cuss. Keep it PG.</p> 
<br>
<p> â€¢ Don't bully or harm other characters or other active patrons. For example, you can't write, 'Lizzie turned around, ready to return home, when John pushed
  her into the lava.' You CAN write, 'Lizzie turned around, ready to return home, when John saved her from falling in the lava in front
  of her.' You CAN put your character in danger, if you do not make it brutal or if your character is severely harmed.
